# Pizza Place Code Challenge

## Instructions

Create a prototype website for a pizza chain. The pizza chain has franchises in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, each with different names. The pizza chain serves three different specialty pizzas: cheese, veggie, and meat. Each franchise has a different name for each specialty pizza and different toppings â€“ but veggie pizzas always have mushrooms and meat pizzas always have pepperoni.
A user must be able to select their city, then select a specialty pizza, and then view the list of toppings for the selected pizza. An online order form and/or any other features you'd like to add are optional.

The company is thinking of expanding in the future, so please give some consideration to how easy it would be to add additional franchises in the future.
